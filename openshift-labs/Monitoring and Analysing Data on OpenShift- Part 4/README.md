# Prometheus Cluster Monitoring

OpenShift Container Platform ships with a pre-configured and self-updating monitoring stack that is based on the Prometheus open source project and its wider eco-system.
It provides monitoring of cluster components and ships with a set of alerts to immediately notify the cluster administrator about any occurring problems and a set of Grafana dashboards.
